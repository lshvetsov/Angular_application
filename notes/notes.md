**Angular** is a framework which allows you to create reactive Single Page Applications (SPA) which means that you don't need to bring a new HTML page from a server for every page rendered for a user in browser. 

**Versioning**
- AngularJS - old, recommended to not use it
- Angular 2+ - actual framework (update in every 6 months)
